Description: Instead of the traditional way of writing R code with comments
    under the R/ directory of a package, you may write R code in R Markdown
    documents or other types of source documents that knitr supports (such as
    .Rnw), and use Literate Programming techniques to extract the R code to the
    R/ directory.
